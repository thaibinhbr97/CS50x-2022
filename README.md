### DISCLAIMER:
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally useless if you actually want to learn how to become a better programmer and it is a violation of the [**Academic Honesty**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/honesty/) policy of the course.
